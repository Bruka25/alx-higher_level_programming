The following files are for ALX 0x0B-python-input_output for the high level language curriculum, inside it contains the following python modules:

* A function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout
* A function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written
* A function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added
* A function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)
* A function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string
* A function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation
* A function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”
* A script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file
* A function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object
* A class Student that defines a student by
    Public instance attributes:
           ->first_name
           ->last_name
           ->age
* A class Student that defines a student by: (based on 9-student.py)
* A class Student that defines a student by: (based on 10-student.py)
* A function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n:
           ->Returns an empty list if n <= 0
           ->You can assume n will be always an integer
* A function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string
* A script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics
