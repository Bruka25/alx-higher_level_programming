* A function magic_string() that returns a string “BestSchool” n times the number of the iteration
* A  class LockedClass with no class or object attribute, that prevents the user from dynamically creating new instance attributes, except if the new instance attribute is called first_name

* Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration:

         How many int objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (103-line1.txt)
         How many int objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (103-line2.txt)
```
a = 1
b = 1
```
* Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration:

         How many int objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (104-line1.txt)
         How many int objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (104-line2.txt)
         After the execution of line 3, is the int object pointed by a deleted? Answer with Yes or No (104-line3.txt)

```
print("I")
print("Love")
print("Python"
```
* Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration (For answers with numbers use integers, don’t spell out the word):
