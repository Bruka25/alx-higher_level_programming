Introduction to Python Data Structures
Python offers a rich collection of data structures that cater to different storage, organization, and manipulation needs in programming. This project aims to explore the key data structures and their functionalities in Python.

Lists in Python
List Operations
Basic list operations (creation, indexing, slicing)
List comprehensions for concise list creation
Sorting and searching techniques
Modifying lists: appending, extending, inserting, deleting

Tuples in Python
Tuple Operations
Creating tuples and accessing elements
Tuple immutability and unpacking
Tuple advantages and use cases

Dictionaries in Python
Dictionary Operations
Basic dictionary operations (key-value pairs)
Accessing, adding, and removing elements
Dictionary comprehensions for efficient dictionary creation

Other Essential Data Structures
Other Data Structures
Sets for unique collection elements
Queues and stacks for data organization
Arrays using libraries like NumPy for numerical operations
Custom data structures tailored to specific needs

The following projects are for ALX 0x04-python-more_data_structures for high level programming curriculum, inside it contains the following python programs:

* A function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix
* A function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list
* A function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer)
* A function that returns a set of common elements in two sets
* A function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set
* A function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary
* A function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys
* A function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary
* A function that deletes a key in a dictionary
* A function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
* A function that returns a key with the biggest integer value
* A function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops
* A function that converts a Roman numeral to an integer
* A function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (<score>, <weight>)
* A function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map
* A function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary
* Two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects
