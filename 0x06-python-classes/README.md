Introduction
Classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). In Python, classes allow you to create new types of objects with their own attributes and methods. This repository provides examples and exercises related to Python classes to help developers become proficient in object-oriented programming.

Installation
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bruka25/alx-higher_level_programming
```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```
cd 0x06-python-classes
```

3. You're ready to explore the code related to Python classes!

Usage

This repository contains Python scripts, each representing a specific question related to Python classes along with its corresponding solution. To make use of the repository:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the Python scripts:

```
cd 0x06-python-classes
```
2. Explore the Python scripts available in the repository. Each Python script is named descriptively to indicate the question it addresses.

3. Open a Python script file to view both the question and its solution within the same file. The script typically consists of the following sections:

         -> Description of the problem or question.
         -> Python code implementing the solution to the problem.

4. Study the provided Python code to understand the problem and solution approach.

5. Modify the code as needed, experiment with different solutions, and test them to deepen your understanding of Python classes.

6. Feel free to use the provided code snippets in your own projects or learning exercises, ensuring to understand how and why they work.
