Introduction

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. In TDD, developers first write failing tests based on the desired behavior of the code, then write the code to make the tests pass, and finally refactor the code as needed. This approach helps ensure that the code meets the specified requirements and remains maintainable over time. This repository provides examples and exercises related to TDD in Python to help developers become proficient in this methodology.

Installation
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bruka25/alx-higher_level_programming
```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```
cd 0x07-python-test_driven_development
```
3. You're ready to explore the code related to test-driven development in Python!

Usage

This repository contains Python scripts and test files, each representing a specific module or functionality that follows the test-driven development approach. To make use of the repository:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the Python scripts and test files:

```
cd 0x07-python-test_driven_development
```

2. Explore the Python scripts and test files available in the repository. Each Python script is accompanied by a corresponding test file with the naming convention test_<module_name>.py.

3. Open a Python script file to view the implementation of the module or functionality.

4. Open the corresponding test file to view the test cases written for the module or functionality.

5. Run the tests using a test runner such as unittest or pytest to ensure that the code behaves as expected:

```
python -m unittest discover
```
or

```
pytest
```
6. Write additional tests as needed to cover edge cases and ensure robustness of the code.

7. Modify the code implementation to make the tests pass, following the principles of test-driven development.

8. Repeat the process of writing tests, implementing code, and refactoring as necessary until the desired functionality is achieved.

9. Feel free to use the provided code snippets and test files as templates for writing tests and developing code in a test-driven manner in your own projects.
