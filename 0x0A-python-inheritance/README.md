0x0A Python Inheritance

Welcome to the "0x0A-python-inheritance" repository! This repository explores the concept of inheritance in Python, which is a fundamentalaspect of object-oriented programming (OOP). Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes, facilitatingcode reuse and promoting modularity in Python programs.

Introduction
Inheritance is a powerful mechanism in Python that enables code reuse and promotes a hierarchical structure in class relationships. With inheritance, a class (subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass), allowing for the extension and specialization of functionality. This repository provides examples and exercises related to inheritance in Python to help developers understand how to leverage this feature effectively.

Installation
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bruka25/alx-higher_level_programming
```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```
cd 0x0A-python-inheritance
```
3. You're ready to explore the code related to inheritance in Python!

Usage
This repository contains Python scripts and examples, each focusing on different aspects of inheritance in Python. To make use of the repository:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the Python scripts:

```
cd 0x0A-python-inheritance
```
2. Explore the Python scripts available in the repository. Each script demonstrates a specific concept related to inheritance.

3. Open a Python script file to view the implementation and explanation of the concept.

4. Study the provided Python code and accompanying explanations to understand how inheritance works in Python and how it can be applied in different scenarios.

5. Experiment with the code, modify it as needed, and test different inheritance hierarchies to deepen your understanding of inheritance in Python.

6. Feel free to use the provided code snippets and examples as references for implementing inheritance in your own Python projects.

The following projects are for python 0x0A-python-inheritance for ALX high level programming, inside it contains the following python classes:

* A function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object
* A class MyList that inherits from list
* A function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False
* A function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False
* A function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False
* An empty class BaseGeometry
* A class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py)
* A class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py)
* A class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py)
* A class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py)
* A class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py)
* A class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py)
* A class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py)
* A class MyInt that inherits from int
* A function that adds a new attribute to an object if it’s possible

     -> Raise a TypeError exception, with the message can't add new attribute if the object can’t have new attribute
     -> You are not allowed to use try/except
     -> You are not allowed to import any module
