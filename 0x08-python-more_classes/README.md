Introduction

Building upon the basics of classes introduced in earlier modules, "0x08-python-more_classes" explores more advanced concepts such as class methods, class attributes, inheritance, and special methods (also known as magic methods) in Python. These concepts are essential for developing complex software systems and understanding the intricacies of object-oriented programming.

Installation

The following python functions are for the ALX 0x08-python-more_classes project for the high level programming lamguage, inside it contains the following python classes:

* An empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle
* A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 0-rectangle.py)
* A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 1-rectangle.py)
* A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 2-rectangle.py)
* A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 3-rectangle.py)
* A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 4-rectangle.py)
* A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 5-rectangle.py)
* A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 6-rectangle.py)
* A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 7-rectangle.py)
* A class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 8-rectangle.py)
* The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

            Usage: nqueens N
            If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit wi            th the status 1
            where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
            If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
            If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
            The program should print every possible solution to the problem
            One solution per line
            Format: see example
            You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
            You are only allowed to import the sys module
