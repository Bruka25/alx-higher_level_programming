Introduction
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to define, access, and manipulate data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS). This repository provides examples and exercises to help developers understand the fundamentals of SQL and become proficient in using SQL for data management and manipulation.

Installation
To use the code and examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Install a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MariaDB on your local machine or server.

2. Install a SQL client or command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the RDBMS. Many RDBMSs come with their own CLI tools, or you can use third-party tools such as DBeaver, pgAdmin, or MySQL Workbench.

3. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bruka25/alx-higher_level_programming
```
4. Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd 0x0D-SQL_introduction
```
5. You're ready to explore the SQL examples and exercises provided in the repository!

Usage

This repository contains SQL scripts and examples, each focusing on different aspects of SQL, such as creating databases, tables, queryingdata, and performing various operations on databases. To make use of the repository:

1. Connect to your local or remote database using the SQL client or CLI tool.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the SQL scripts:

```
cd 0x0D-SQL_introduction
```

3. Explore the SQL scripts available in the repository. Each script demonstrates a specific concept or operation in SQL.

4. Open a SQL script file to view the SQL queries and commands used to perform various operations on databases.

5. Study the provided SQL code and accompanying explanations to understand how SQL queries are structured and how they manipulate data in a relational database.

6. Experiment with the SQL code, modify it as needed, and execute the queries to observe the results.

7. Feel free to use the provided SQL scripts and examples as references for working with SQL databases in your own projects.
