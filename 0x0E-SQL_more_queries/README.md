Introduction
"0x0E-SQL_more_queries" builds upon the foundational knowledge of SQL introduced in previous modules, delving into more advanced querying techniques and data manipulation operations. It covers a wide range of SQL topics, including joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, data modification commands, and database administration tasks, to provide developers with a comprehensive understanding of SQL and its applications in database management and analysis.

Installation
To use the code and examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MariaDB installed on your local machine or server.

2. Install a SQL client or command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the RDBMS. Many RDBMSs come with their own CLI tools, or you can use third-party tools such as DBeaver, pgAdmin, or MySQL Workbench.

3. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bruka25/alx-higher_level_programming
```
4. Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd 0x0E-SQL_more_queries
```

5. You're ready to explore the advanced SQL examples and exercises provided in the repository!

Usage
This repository contains SQL scripts and examples, each focusing on different advanced SQL topics, such as joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, data modification commands, and database administration tasks. To make use of the repository:

1. Connect to your local or remote database using the SQL client or CLI tool.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the SQL scripts:

```
cd 0x0E-SQL_more_queries
```

3. Explore the SQL scripts available in the repository. Each script demonstrates a specific advanced SQL concept or operation.

4. Open a SQL script file to view the SQL queries and commands used to perform advanced SQL operations.

5. Study the provided SQL code and accompanying explanations to understand how advanced SQL queries are structured and how they manipulate data in a relational database.

6. Experiment with the SQL code, modify it as needed, and execute the queries to observe the results.

7. Feel free to use the provided SQL scripts and examples as references for working with advanced SQL techniques in your own projects.
