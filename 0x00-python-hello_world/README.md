 Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple paradigms and is widely used for various applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

Hello, World! Program
Python "Hello, World!" Example
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
The "Hello, World!" program is a simple Python script that demonstrates the print() function to output the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

Bytecode Generation
Python code is translated into bytecode before execution. To view the bytecode generated for the "Hello, World!" program, you can use the dis module:

```
import dis

def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

dis.dis(hello_world)
```

The dis module disassembles the bytecode for the hello_world() function, providing insight into the underlying operations performed by Python.

Repository Structure
```
hello_world.py: Contains the "Hello, World!" Python script.
bytecode_analysis.py: Python script to disassemble and analyze the bytecode.
```

README.md: Repository documentation providing an overview and instructions.

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bruka25/alx-higher_level_programming
cd 0x00-python-hello_world
```

Run the Python scripts:

To execute the "Hello, World!" program:

```
python hello_world.py
```

To view bytecode analysis:

```
python bytecode_analysis.py
```

Contributing
Contributions to enhance the understanding of Python bytecode or to expand on the "Hello, World!" example are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
