The following programs are for ALX 0x03-python-data_structures project, and inside the directory it contains the following python scripts:

* A function that prints all integers of a list
* A function that retrieves an element from a list like in C
* A function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C)
* A function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order
* A function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C)
* A function that removes all characters c and C from a string
* A function that prints a matrix of integers
* A function that adds 2 tuples
* A function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character
* A function that finds the biggest integer of a list
* A function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list
* A  function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list

Introduction to Lists and Tuples
Lists and tuples are fundamental data structures in Python:

Lists: Mutable sequences that can contain a variety of data types and are defined by square brackets [].
Tuples: Immutable sequences typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data and are defined by parentheses ().
List Operations
Basic List Operations
Creating a list
Accessing elements
Slicing lists
Modifying elements
Appending and extending lists
Removing elements
List comprehension
Tuple Operations
Basic Tuple Operations
Creating a tuple
Accessing elements
Slicing tuples
Concatenating tuples
Replicating tuples
Tuple unpacking

Repository Structure
